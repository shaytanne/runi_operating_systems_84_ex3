/**
 * @file fs.h
 * @brief Header file for the OnlyFiles filesystem implementation
 * 
 * This header defines the structures and function prototypes for a simple
 * block-based filesystem implementation. The filesystem supports basic file
 * operations but does not include directories, permissions, or other advanced
 * features found in production filesystems.
 *
 * The filesystem is designed to be contained within a single disk image file,
 * with a fixed layout of metadata and data blocks.
 *
 * DO NOT MODIFY THIS HEADER FILE FOR YOUR IMPLEMENTATION.
